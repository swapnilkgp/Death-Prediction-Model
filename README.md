We are provided with a dataset 'train.csv' which contains an enormous number of anonymized patient-related information who were affected from covid including pre-conditions compiled from different medical sources from rural and urban areas. 
The raw dataset consists of 22 unique features and about 1M unique 
patients. In the Boolean features, 1 means "yes" and 2 means "No". 
Values as 97, 98 and 99 are missing data.
We will train a Machine Learning model from the features provided and 
try to predict whether a patient will die or not under the given features.
The model helps to predict the probability of death of a patient which can 
actually help a medical centre to judge the condition of an incoming 
patient. 
This will be important to understand and predict the type of care a COVID 
patient should be given when admitted to a medical centre.
